				<h3>Short peek</h3>
				<p> Author: Gillian Flynn<br> Language: English<br> Length: 480 pages </p>
                <p id = "prodesc">On a warm summer morning in North Carthage, Missouri, it is Nick and Amy Dunne’s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents are being wrapped and reservations are being made when Nick’s clever and beautiful wife disappears. Husband-of-the-Year Nick isn’t doing himself any favors with cringe-worthy daydreams about the slope and shape of his wife’s head, but passages from Amy's diary reveal the alpha-girl perfectionist could have put anyone dangerously on edge. Under mounting pressure from the police and the media—as well as Amy’s fiercely doting parents—the town golden boy parades an endless series of lies, deceits, and inappropriate behavior. Nick is oddly evasive, and he’s definitely bitter—but is he really a killer? </p>

			<h2>Reviews</h2>
				<p class = "psummary">Awesome book that will hold your breath till the last page - published 3 days ago by Sam Richard </p>
				<p class = "psummary" >Wow, what a great book. Lots of twists and turns. Nice study of people and how they view themselves, and others, men vs. women. Nice study of our society, and media bias. Hard to put down. The ending is different in the book vs. the movie -published 1 week ago by Neilson white</p>
				<p class = "psummary" > This was one of the best books I've ever read. The story was very dark and disturbing. It was also very original. As it goes on, we get too see where it started, where it went wrong and what it has come to be. Each character is deeply developed and since the story is told in the first person you only get to hear what the characters want you to hear - published 10 days ago by Andrew Keller</p>
